Jamaica, where Brown informs us it grows to the height of 5 or 6 feet.
The plant is at present so scarce as not to be enumerated in the
Catalogue of the Cambridge Garden; nor has any figure of it, to our
knowledge, been before published. Specimens were communicated by A. B.
Lambert, esq. from his stove at Boyton, where he informs us that the
plant is now about five feet high, with some of the lower leaves a foot
and a half long; that it began to blossom in the middle of July, and
continued to the end of November; four or five racemes flowering at the
same time, and nodding in the manner of ostrich plumes; the blossoms
gradually opening in succession towards the top, and the racemes
continuing to lengthen until more than a foot long. The flowers have
withered without producing any seed. The plant appears to be perennial.</p>

in the gardens has long been supposed to be the plant which produced the
Grains of Paradise, Amomum Granum Paradisi of Linnæus; but it certainly
by no means accords with the character of that plant, either as given in
the Hortus Kewensis or by Linnæus himself. From the other species of
Zingiber enumerated in the eighth volume of the Linnæan Society’s
Transactions it is easily distinguished. Having as yet only blossomed in
England in the collection of Lady de Clifford at Paddington, in honour
of that patroness and lover of botany we have given its specific
designation. The culture is the same as for other plants of the family.
Our drawing was taken in 1804.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Several</span> species of the genus Pancratium approach so very near to each
other, that it is a difficult task to discriminate them with accuracy.
We have little doubt that the <i>Pancratium foliis amplis ovatis</i> of Ehret
(Trew’s Plantæ Selectæ, tab. 28.) belongs to our plant, notwithstanding
the absence of the little teeth between the lobes of the nectary.
Indeed, that character appears so variable in the synonyms commonly
given to this species, that we are rather inclined to doubt of its
constancy. Neither are the painters of those days always safely to be
trusted in such minutiæ. Mr. Lambert, who favoured us with the specimen
in March 1808, informs us that he received the bulbs from Lord Seaforth,
on his return to England from the West Indies, from the <i>Pancratium
caribæum</i>, cultivated in the same collection. It is certainly distinct;
the blossoms are extremely fragrant, and we are not yet certain whether
the amœnum and fragrans of botanists may not be the same species.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Assa</span> fœtida grows naturally near Gilan in Persia; and from seeds sent
from thence to the Academy at St. Petersburgh plants were obtained, two
of which were sent to Dr. Hope at Edinburgh, by Dr. Guthrie, to whom
they had been presented by Professor Pallas, in whose herbarium we have
seen specimens of it, but without fructification. One of these plants
flowered and ripened seeds in the Botanic Garden at Edinburgh, and is
described by Dr. Hope in the lxxvth vol. of the Philosophical
Transactions, and a figure annexed, the only one hitherto published of
the species; the Assa fœtida of Kæmpfer being undoubtedly a different
plant. Our specimens were obligingly communicated by Dr. Williams from
the Botanic Garden at Oxford; which, with that of Edinburgh above
mentioned, the Cambridge Garden, the Physic Gardens at Chelsea, and Mr.
Dickson’s private collection at Croydon, are the only gardens in
Britain, as we are informed, that yet possess the plant. The gum exudes
from the roots, which are tuberous and perennial, on the slightest
incision being made; and every part of the plant, even to the
extremities of the leaves, smells strongly of it. It is hardy enough to
bear our climate, and even ripen its seeds in mild seasons. It is not
improbable that at a future time we may be furnished with this valuable
article of the Materia Medica, of English growth. The long list of its
virtues mentioned by Dr. Woodville we need not here enumerate; its
reputation as a cordial for low spirits alone, in these days, entitles
it to notice.</p>

It was introduced to the Clapham gardens about the year 1803; and as we
have not seen it since that period, we are inclined to think it is not
at present in this country. In the herbarium of A. B. Lambert, esq. we
found a fine native specimen of an unnamed species very much resembling
our plant, but with a profusion of flowers&mdash;a habit which ours would in
all probability have assumed as soon as it had been familiarized to the

several years in some choice collections adorned the green-house and
conservatory in early spring with its fine heads of flowers; but to whom
we are indebted for its first introduction we are uncertain. Some
botanists have considered it as a congener of Forster’s <i>Codia</i>, to
which it has certainly a considerable affinity; but as we cannot exactly
see the propriety of coupling an apetalous flower having so many stamens
with one that is penta-petalous and octandrous, and of which we have no
description of the germen or fruit; and there being great probability
that more plants of this family may be discovered in the vast tracts of
New Holland yet unexplored, we have rather chose to describe it as
distinct, than to excuse ourselves by leaving it to be separated at some
future period and create more changes of names, a circumstance always to
be deprecated and avoided as much as possible by Naturalists. Callicoma
is a middle-sized shrub with the leaves finely cottony and whitish on
the under side, and has considerable beauty even when out of blossom. It
is propagated by layers.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Instead</span> of a new plant, we here submit to our readers one that according
to the Kew Catalogue has been an inhabitant of our gardens 239 years:
but neither Mr. Alton nor Mr. Miller had ever seen it blossom, nor
during all this long period have we any account of its flowering in this
country. Its male flowers however appeared in the Cambridge Botanic
Garden the beginning of last February, and from a specimen communicated
by Mr. Donn to A. B. Lambert, esq. the present drawing was taken. Mr.
Donn’s plant was between 4 and 5 feet high, moderately branched, and had
the same treatment as his other green-house shrubs. We are uncertain
whether the hermaphrodite or female plant be yet in this country; but as
the propagation is principally from seed, we think it is very probable.
The stamens in our specimen vary in number, being commonly 5, sometimes
6, and more rarely 8. The fruit is added from a dried legume in the
Lambertian collection, which was sent from Spain by the late Abbé
Cavanilles, who in his <i>Icones Plantarum</i>, <i>vol.</i> 2. <i>p.</i> 8. and <i>tab.</i>
113. (in addition to what was formerly known of the Ceratonia) informs
us, that it grows spontaneously on little hills and dry fields in
Valencia, and is yet more impatient of cold and moisture than the olive,
vast numbers being sometimes killed there by the frost in severe
winters. It is in this province also, that the principal cultivation of
this useful plant in Spain is situated. The propagation is from seeds,
and the diœcious plants are always selected in preference to the
hermaphrodites, being better bearers. Some of the more skilful
cultivators engraft a male bough upon their female plants for their
impregnation, and by this means have no sterile plants in their
collections. They flower twice a year, first in February, and again more
plentifully in August and September; which is also the time of the
fruit’s ripening, and the trees are seen at the same time adorned with
blossoms, and laden with ripe fruit. Eighty pounds of legumes are
sometimes collected from a single tree. They are known to be mature by
their putting on a chesnut colour, and are then beaten from the trees by
canes of the <i>Arundo Donax</i> from 16 to 20 feet long, with part of their
crooked roots left, which serve as hooks. Rain is said to be beneficial
to the ripe fruits, and even to improve them after they are laid in
heaps on the ground. They are finally dried and stored up in barns for
use. The cultivators enumerate three varieties, which they call
<i>Melars</i>, <i>Llandars</i>, and <i>Costelluts</i>. The last they distinguish by
having larger leaves and of a deeper green, with legumes often a foot
long, but with little solidity or sweetness; the second has shorter
legumes, but more solid and very sweet; the leaves also are shorter. The
first are called Melars (<i>quasi Melleas</i>) from <i>Mel</i> honey, of which the
fruit contains small drops, and sometimes in such abundance that it
distils upon the ground, and is fed upon by the bees. The fruits are the
principal food of the cattle in the province of Valencia, and also form
part of the sustenance of the poor people. The leaves are used in the
preparation of leather. Monsieur Olivier also informs us in his <i>Travels
in the Ottoman Empire</i>, that the Carob-tree grows all over the Island of
Crete, and delights most in stony grounds and the clefts of rocks; that
the fruits are conveyed thence to Constantinople, to Syria and Egypt,
and serve for food to the poor and to children. They are also an
ingredient in the sherbets of which the Mussulmans make daily use.</p>

delicate Ixias, elegant Ericas, superb Amaryllises, and magnificent
Proteas, received from the Cape of Good Hope alone within these few

the mine is yet unexhausted, as our present charming subject, not before
enumerated in any of our catalogues of cultivated plants will testify.

Having forwarded the first a little too early, being struck with the
singular beauty, and not knowing the habits of the plant, a fortnight
after he forwarded a third specimen fully expanded, from which the
figure is taken. Mr. Milne informs us, that he raised the Liparia from
Cape seeds some years ago, and has kept it in the conservatory, where it
is now in blossom. The plant is branchy, and between four and five feet
in height. He thinks he possesses two more new species of the genus
raised at the same time, which have not yet blossomed with him.</p>

able to learn. The specimen was communicated by A. B. Lambert, esq. in
the beginning of April from his collection at Boyton, and we have also
seen the plant very finely in flower at Mr. Whitley’s nursery, Brompton.
Its woolly leaves and branches, contrasted with the Mimosas and other
hard-leaved plants from the same country, make an agreeable variety, and
the early blossoms are very ornamental. The plants we have seen are
moderate-sized branchy shrubs, are kept in the green-house like other
New Holland plants, and require no particular treatment. We have seen
more species from the same country in herbariums, and some are now alive
in this country, although they have not yet blossomed.</p>

when any of them appear to have ripened their seed perfectly, we

perfectly hardy, but is with difficulty raised by layers; which accounts
for its being (after a period of sixteen years since its first

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> rare plant, enumerated in the Hortus Kewensis upon the authority of
Sutherland’s Catalogue of the Plants in the Physic Garden at Edinburgh,
published in 1683, has been long a desideratum in our collections. It
grows naturally in dry sandy places about Montpelier, and also in the
southern provinces of the Russian empire, from whence we have seen fine
specimens collected by Professor Pallas in Mr. Lambert’s Herbarium,
which now contains the whole collection made at the expense of the
Russian Government, during the space of 30 years, by that great
naturalist and his assistants. The plant is well calculated for
ornamenting rock-works, or light sandy and gravelly borders. The roots
are an article of trade, and used to give a red colour to oils, wax, and
spirits of wine. Linnæus, after having very properly arranged this plant
as a Lithospermum in the first edition of his Species Plantarum,
afterwards removed it to the genus Anchusa, which alteration has since
been adopted by every editor of his works. The character, however, is
decidedly that of a Lithospermum; and the alteration would be difficult
to account for, were it not for a memorandum of the late M. L’Heritier
(published in the Flore Française), stating that he had seen another
plant under that name in the Linnæan herbarium. It therefore appears
that Linnæus, after having described the true plant, from his not
possessing a specimen of it had afterwards mistaken some species of
Anchusa for it. The plant, however, was retained in its proper genus by
Gerard in his Flora Gallico-Provincialis, and he has since been followed
by Decandolle in the Flore Française. We are aware of Professor Vahl and
Willdenow’s having given to another Lithospermum the name of tinctorium;
but if the genus Arnebia of Forskahl is given up, the characteristic
specific of tetrastigma applied to it by Lamarck may be restored. We
have never seen any figure of the plant but that of Plenck, Aubriet’s in
Alyon’s Cours de Botanique, and the wooden cut of John Bauhin; the plant
figured under the name of Anchusa tinctoria in Woodville’s Medical
Botany being the Anchusa officinalis. Specimens were communicated by A.
B. Lambert, esq., and there is also a fine spreading plant of it now in
blossom (May 27th) in the natural ground, in Mr. Harrison’s nursery at
Brompton.</p>

of the Creoles in Martinico, a shrub, the young shoots of which are
greedily sought for and eaten by their cattle, particularly goats,
whence the name (in English) Goatwood; and which Jacquin, following the
botanical canon, elegantly turned into Ægiphila. With this species the
celebrated Swartz has conjoined the Knoxia of Browne’s Jamaica and
Manabea lævis of Aublet’s Guiana, and added two more species, Æ. fœtida
and Æ. trifida, discovered by himself; and Willdenow has yet further
augmented it with the Manabea villosa and arborescens of Aublet, and the
Nuxia of Lamarck: the last, however, we consider as a very doubtful
species. That fine collection of plants from the West Indies, introduced
in 1807 by lord Seaforth, and by him presented to A. B. Lambert, esq.
and which we have already so often quoted, has brought to our knowledge
two more species, which we have denominated diffusa and obovata, from
what appeared to us to be their most prominent features. Both shrubs are
natives of the West Indies, and were sent to us in flower in August
1808. They are propagated by cuttings, and have not yet ripened seeds in
England, but produce flowers annually in abundance during the months of
July and August.</p>

Carniola, and on the banks of the Tanais in the Russian empire where it
was found by Gerber in 1741. It grows to be a tree of rather small size,
and is much cultivated in Italy, in the South of France, and in Sicily,
for the sake of the fruit, which is as large as a cherry, of a fine red
colour with sometimes a tinge of yellow, and is said to have a very
agreeable flavour. At present the Azarole is very scarce in this
country, and we have never seen it in blossom but at Burchall’s nursery
at Fulham, in May 1808, when our drawing was made. This year the plant
has produced no blossoms. To those who are desirous of cultivating the
Azarole, and adding another variety to their deserts, we would recommend
planting it in well sheltered situations; or perhaps training against a
wall, as practised for peaches and other delicate fruits, would be still
better. Considerable trees of the Azarole formerly existed in His
Majesty’s Gardens at Kew, and in those of the Duke or Northumberland at
Sion House; and we have lately seen the remains of one in Mr. Swainson’s
collection at Twickenham; but we are not aware that any exist at present
in England. That of Plenck excepted, in His Medical Plants, Pl. 390, we
believe no other coloured figure of it has before been published.</p>

of cultivators. It is by training it up against the glass, and watering
it very sparingly; indeed, so little water is requisite for many of the
succulent plants, that we have seen them thrive very well without any,
except what they absorb from the humidity of the atmosphere in the
descending dews.</p>

native of Russia or Siberia, and to have been introduced by Mr. John
Bell of Sion Gate about the year 1798. Whether it may or may not be the

it then in England. A. B. Lambert, esq. who communicated the specimens
in July last from his garden at Boyton, informs us that Dr. Williams,
regius professor of botany at Oxford, favoured him with the plant; and
his predecessor Dr. Sibthorpe, who made two journeys into Greece to
enrich us with the natural history of that interesting country, was
probably the re-introducer. The name Samia is derived from the island of
Samos; but Monsieur Desfontaines informs us (in his Flora Atlantica)
that the original Samian plant of Tournefort and the Phlomis Samia of
Linnæus (which he found wild about Mount Atlas) are different species.
Both may possibly be natives of Samos: the posthumous Flora Græca of Dr.
Sibthorpe, now publishing by his friend Dr. Smith, will, we trust,
decide it. There is no prior figure of the plant.</p>

its flowering in this country, we learn, was in his Grace the Duke of
Northumberland’s collection at Sion, in August 1797. The only figure we
have seen is in Jacquin’s Hortus Schœnbrunnensis, vol. iii. Burmann, in
his Flora Indica, and after him Linnæus, describe the flowers as white.
In Mr. Ord’s garden they are of a faint yellow, as in the figure of
Jacquin; and in the specimens which we have seen from Sion House, faint
yellow tinged with purple. Excellent in the study of flowers is the
maxim of Virgil,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">We</span> can but seldom have the pleasure of recording so valuable an
acquisition to our collections as this truly magnificent species,
introduced from China by the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks about the year
1807, and a figure of it also published by him in 1791, being plate 47
of the Icones Selectæ, from drawings made in Japan by Kæmpfer, and now
deposited in the British Museum. The woolliness and bulbs on the stem in
our specimen, and the want of constriction at the base of the leaves,
(if any such ever exists in nature,) differ considerably from the figure
above quoted; but the strong general resemblance, and a consideration of
the many variations to which other species of this genus are subject,
induce us to regard it as a variety from the same common stock. The stem
rises to between three and four feet in height, and sometimes even
higher; and produces from three to nine or more flowers, according to
its strength and situation. The bulb which it produces from the base of
every leaf forms a future plant, and thus to unrivalled beauty adds
abundance. Its time of flowering enhances its value, being in August,
when all other lilies have deserted the parterre. Mr. Williams,
nurseryman at Turnham Green, favoured us with the specimen.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> elegant shrub is amply described in the Flora Japonica of Professor
Thunberg, who found it growing naturally about Nagasaki, Miaco, and
various parts of the Japanese empire; where it is also commonly
cultivated for ornament. The double variety here figured he particularly
specifies as naturally adorning the country about Miaco. In Houttuyn’s
Pflanrensystem, vol. vii. plate 54, there is also an engraving of it.
The single-flowered has not yet been introduced to this country. The
time of blossoming is in early spring: but it does not appear to confine
itself to that season, as we have been favoured with fresh specimens at
various seasons from April to October; and we may therefore safely
predict its being long a favourite with cultivators. The flexile twigs
starred with blossoms look at a little distance like garlands, and
extend when supported to a great length. All the flowers that we have
seen are from 5-to 8-gynous; which, with the singular form of the
capsule, makes us consider it as a very doubtful species of Corchorus.
The Japanese name is Jamma Buki.</p>

99 species; and the new species brought from Abyssinia by Lord Valentia,

growing naturally in Peru and Lima in moist places; and A. B. Lambert,

Hon. the Marquis of Bath, who first observed it to be distinct from the
Mespilus tanacetifolia, with which it has commonly been confounded, and
pointed out the specific differences to Mr. Lambert in 1807. The
accuracy of his Lordship’s observations we have often verified this
summer in the different collections about London, and find the two
species quite distinct in fruit, foliage, and bracteæ. Mespilus
odoratissima forms handsome dwarf trees, from 6 to 12 feet high in the
specimens we have seen. The blossoms appear in June, and are remarkably
fragrant, but considerably smaller than in M. tanacetifolia; but this is
abundantly compensated by the livelier colour and greater profusion of
the fruit with which the boughs are loaded in autumn. The tree called by
Professor Pallas Cratægus orientalis, (see the English translation of
his Travels in the Crimea, vol. ii. p. 174 and 181,) and which he found
cultivated for its fruit in the south-western parts of the Crimea, where
it also grows wild on the mountains, is this species, as we have
ascertained from his Herbarium; and the little red Medlar found in
Anatolia by Tournefort, (see his Travels, vol. ii. p. 322 of the English
translation,) noticed by Dr. Smith in his Exotic Botany, is probably the
same thing. We were favoured with the specimens both of this and M.
tanacetifolia (our next plate) by the Right Hon. the Marchioness of
Bath, from Longleat.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Neither</span> is this species enumerated in the works of Linnæus. The great
French botanist Tournefort, who discovered it on the mountains of
Anatolia in 1701, thus describes it: “These mountains produce a fine
sort of Azarolíer or Medlar-tree; there are some as big as oaks. Their
trunk is covered with a cleft grayish bark; the branches are bushy, and
spreading out on the sides; the leaves are in bunches two inches and a
half long, fifteen lines broad, shining, a little hairy on both sides,
commonly divided into three parts even to the rib, and these parts
indented very neatly on the edges, pretty much like the leaves of tansy;
the part at the end of the leaf is again divided into three parts. The
fruit grow two or three together at the end of the young shoots, and
resemble small apples of an inch diameter with five roundings like the
ribs of a melon, a little hairy, pale green inclining to a yellow, with
a navel raised of five leaves. We sometimes find one or two of these
leaves growing out of the flesh of the fruit, or its stalk. The fruit
though agreeable is not so pleasant as our Medlar, but I believe it
would be excellent if it were cultivated. The Armenians not only eat as
much of this as they can, but likewise fill their bags. The short period
the tree has been introduced (not above 20 years, as we are informed)
will not allow any in England, as yet, to have reached the size above
mentioned; and we much doubt whether it may be thought worthy of
cultivation here for the fruit: but the beauty of the tree and agreeable
fragrance of the blossoms sufficiently recommend it to a place in the
pleasure-garden. This and the last described species with the artificial
characters of the genus Mespilus have all the natural habits of
Cratægus, and show how ill even our most admired systems are calculated
to trace and mark these fine gradations, which, while they yet
distinguish, closely connect all nature. Too often the hue and cry of
“Heretics! Innovators!” thundered out by the schools against all who
will not implicitly follow their dogmas, drive the calm and unprejudiced
students of nature out of the field. Yet he that discovers one new truth
is surely a benefactor to society; but he that defends and inculcates
error is a tyrant in the kingdom of Nature.</p>

species has before been published. Its place in the genus is near to the
Crotalaria juncea figured in our sixth volume.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">On</span> examining the flowers of this curious and rare species of Panax, we
were a little startled to find how widely they differed from the
character of the genus; being trigynous, and the berry three-seeded.
Professor Jacquin has also observed the same variation in the flowers of
P. aculeatum (see his Icones, tab. 634); and fifty years ago Trew
observed and delineated the same number of styles in Panax trifolium,
one of the original species upon which the genus was established. Nor
had this escaped the scrutinizing eye of that profound observer of
nature Bernard Jussieu. From these authorities, therefore, in consonance
with our own observations, we have enlarged the character of the genus
to include the species. Panax fruticosum, as we learn from Rumphius’s
Herbarium Amboinense, vol. iv. p. 78 and 79, rises to between five and
six feet in height, with a stem as thick as a man’s arm, and grows
naturally in the Island of Ternate, where it is also much cultivated by
the natives for food, medicine, and œconomy; being planted to separate
the areas of their gardens and mark the boundaries of their fields. The
boiled leaves are eaten as greens, and a decoction both of the leaves
and root is used successfully in nephritic diseases, for which they also
sometimes prescribe the roots to be eaten raw. The fame of the plant as
a powerful diuretic is also great in Amboyna; where, as well as in
Ternate, it is commonly planted both for ornament and use.
Labillardiere, the French botanist, who accompanied the expedition that
sailed in quest of the unfortunate Lapeyrouse, informs us (in his
account of the voyage) that when at Amboyna he found this plant
encircling the tomb of the venerable Rumphius, its first described.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">For</span> the first tolerable figure of the Cinnamon tree we are indebted to
Dr. Hermann, Professor of Botany at Leyden who had also the honour of
introducing it to Europe, having brought living plants with him, on his
return from Ceylon, which vegetated in the Leyden Academy’s garden, and
in the gardens of Mynheers Benting and Beverning between two and three
years, until a severe winter destroyed them. See his Catalogue of the
Plants in the Leyden Garden (Horti Academici Lugduno-Batavi Catalogus),
page 130, plates 665 and 666. This fact is the more curious, as Linnæus,
describing the Cinnamon from dried specimens in his noble patron
Clifford’s collection, fifty years after, speaks of it as a plant
forbidden to our shores; which Europe had never seen alive, and could
hardly hope to see, or to retain even if it could be procured.</p>

<p>The Cinnamon was first cultivated in England by Mr. Miller in the
Apothecaries’ garden at Chelsea about the year 1768; who probably
received it from Holland, the Spice plantations at that time being
entirely in the hands of the Dutch. No figure of it has before been
published in this country, nor any account of its flowering. It grows
naturally in the Island of Ceylon, from whence the vast quantity
annually imported into Europe is supplied. The following method of
procuring and preparing the bark is abridged from Thunberg’s Travels.
Proper trees being selected, that is, those that are neither too young
nor too old, the branches of three years growth are cut off with a
pruning-knife, and their green outer bark scraped off with a crooked
knife. The remaining bark is then ripped up lengthwise and peeled off
and the smaller pieces being drawn into the larger, they are laid in the
sun to dry. After being sufficiently dried, they are tied up in bundles
of about 30 pounds weight each, and brought to the Company’s
storehouses, where inspectors appointed for that purpose examine every
bundle by tasting of it; and on its being approved of, it is tied in
bundles of about 85 pounds weight each, which are then sewed into double
woollen sacks, over which black pepper is strewed to attract any
remaining moisture, and in this state shipped for Europe. From the dust
and fragments remaining in the warehouses the extremely valuable and
rare oil of Cinnamon is distilled. An oil is also distilled from the
leaves, another from the fruit, and a fourth from the bark of the root.</p>

<p>Cinnamon is also found wild in the woods of Martinico, according to
Professor Jacquin; but the Ceylon Cinnamon is always considered the
best.</p>

<p>We are informed by our friend Mr. Anderson, that a Cinnamon tree in the
garden of the Bishop of Winchester at Farnham Castle (perhaps the finest
in England) has for many years blossomed and ripened its fruit annually,
and that great numbers of young trees have been raised from the fruit,
which have far surpassed for healthiness and hardiness the plants
commonly obtained from layers, or those imported; and which leads us to
hope that the Cinnamon trees may soon become more common and less
difficult of cultivation: and his lordship’s great success with it will,
we hope, serve to stimulate others. We have also seen a drawing in Mr.
Lambert’s collection, taken in the Bishop of Durham’s garden at
Mongewell, where it flowered, as we are informed by his lordship, in
February 1796.</p>

<p>The Cinnamon tree requires to be kept in the bark-bed in the stove, and
is propagated by cuttings and layers.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Tropæolum peregrinum grows naturally in Peru, and was gathered wild
by the French naturalist Feuillée near the town of Lima. The native
name, according to that author, is Malla; the Spaniards call it
Paxarito, which signifies a little bird; from the resemblance the
expanded blossoms have to little humming-birds flying. Attaching itself
by the long footstalks of the leaves to the branches, the plant often
ascends to the very summits of trees in its native soil; and Professor
Jacquin, director of the Emperor of Germany’s gardens at Schœnbrunn,
informs us (in the work above quoted) that it grew there in the open
ground to twenty-six feet in length, with a stem of a finger’s
thickness, and a great many branches, but produced no flowers until
transplanted into the green-house. A. B. Lambert, esq. who communicated
the specimen from his gardens at Boyton last November, informs us that
he cultivated it in a three-light melon-frame, which it completely
filled, branching in all directions, and producing almost innumerable
blossoms. The seeds but rarely ripen in this country, and are generally
imported from Spain or Portugal. The plant, however, may be propagated
by cuttings. Besides the five species of Tropæolum enumerated in the
edition of the Species Plantarum by Willdenow, and the new species in
our last volume (T. pennatum), three more species are described and
figured in the Flora Peruviana of Ruiz and Pavon; some of which, and
others of the many beautiful flowers of that country, the great
intercourse now carried on with South America gives us to hope that we
may soon see. One of the species in the Flora Peruviana having only two
petals, has obliged us to make a little alteration in the generic
character.</p>

others) for the courteous, friendly, and honest disposition of the men,
and the inflexible virtue of the females, (see his Second Voyage, vol.
ii. p. 105 to 127.) and whence every day brought them something new in
natural history, this plant with many others was discovered by the two
Forsters, who accompanied him as naturalists, and is published in their
Genera of Plants gathered in the Islands of the South Seas as a species
of Leptospermum. Dr. Smith, however, justly observes, that neither the
number of stamens, the fruit, nor the opposite leaves, agree at all with
that genus, but most naturally with the Linnean genus Bæckia, of which
several species have lately been found in New Holland. The stamens vary
from eight to ten; the germen three-celled, with about sixteen seeds in
each; but how many of these ripen we have had no opportunity of
observing. The leaves are not absolutely without nerves, as described by
Forster; we find them faintly three-nerved in his own specimen, but they
are more conspicuously so after they become dry, particularly on the
under side. In the specimens with which we have been favoured by Mr.
Milne from Fonthill, the leaves are a little smaller than those upon the
original specimen, which may be occasioned by this plant’s being yet so
young, being raised only three years ago in the collection of the
Marquis of Bath. The time of flowering is October. The Leptospermum
virgatum of Willdenow we cannot quote, his descriptions being from two
plants of very different genera jumbled together into one species.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the 277th Number of The Botanical Magazine the writer,
endeavouring to destroy the authority of the figure of Yucca
gloriosa in The Botanist’s Repository, vol. vii., and establish
that of his own as the first, says that our figure cannot belong to
that plant, in which “the trunk reaches only from six inches to two
feet (Miller says in his Dictionary, from two feet and a half to
three feet!) in height, and where the leaves are quite entire; but
to Y. aloifolia, whose trunk reaches from 6 to 10 feet in height,
and the leaves have a finely crenulate edging.” Our drawing was
taken at Lord Boston’s from a plant only ten feet high, the stem
little more than three, and the leaves not in the least crenated!
The panicle in our figure is also said to be much closer than in
that, with its branches likewise more lax and drooping. With all
these contradictory qualities, however, it very much resembles
Barreliere’s figure of the same, which the writer himself has
quoted, and in which the curvature of the buds, which he holds to
be so extraordinary, is also conspicuous. No less curious is his
objection to the tinge of purple on the flowers. Could it be
possible that he had not seen either the plant that he way
describing or the drawing of it? (See the figure in The Botanical
Magazine.) But we leave the Yuccas to speak for themselves. The
filamentosa he has also complimented with five feet of a stem
(Botanical Magazine, No. 900), and quoted Micham’s authority for
it, although that author expressly says that it is stemless! </p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Dwarf Fan-Palm is the only species indigenous to Europe, where it
grows naturally in Italy on the coast of Etruria, in the Island of
Sicily, and in Spain in the province of Valencia, where we are informed
by Cavanilles, in his Icones Plantarum, (vol. ii. p. 12.) it is most
commonly found stemless, and in that tract called Desierto de las
Palmas, or the Desert of Palms, with stems rarely exceeding two feet in
height. In the district of Xabea, however, on the coast of the
Mediterranean, he found many with stems fourteen feet high, and one as
high as thirty feet. The same author informs us that the lower part of
the stem, which enters the earth, and the heads of young blossoms before
they burst from the sheath, are eaten by the Spaniards, to whom also the
leaves are of the greatest utility, furnishing them with mats, ropes,
brooms, and baskets, in the manufacture of which boys are principally
employed, and women during the evenings in winter. Many of our fair
countrywomen, we fear, spend their evenings less usefully. Professor
Pontedera, in his Anthologia, published at Padua in 1720, has given
three good plates of the Chamærops and its fructification, taken from a
plant, the stem of which was twelve feet high, growing in the public
garden there. From this author we learn that the young shoots or suckers
from the bottom of the plant (called there cefaglioni) are eaten by the
Italians. The Chamærops also grows spontaneously upon uncultivated hills
on the coast of Barbary, where the lower part of the young stems and the
roots are also eaten by the Moors; and the leaves, after being macerated
in water, made into mats, ropes, baskets, &amp;c., as in Spain. (See
Desfontaines’ Flora Atlantica, vol. iii. p. 473.) Willdenow takes notice
of two varieties of the Chamærops, one of which is nearly stemless, and
the other twenty feet in height; and the former of which is probably
that cultivated in England, as we have never met with any of a large
size, although the plant has been in our gardens since the year 1731;
while that in the Jardin des Plantes at Paris, (nearly twenty feet
high,) mentioned by Chevalier Lamarck in the Encyclopédie Méthodique,
seems to be the second variety. Our drawing was taken early in March, in
Malcolm’s Nursery at Kensington, from a male plant about two feet in
height with three fine bunches of male blossoms.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> curious and interesting plant, originally considered as a species
of Banisteria by Linnæus, was very properly separated and named in
honour of the celebrated Gærtner by Schreber in his Genera Plantarum;
and Cavanilles nearly about the same time published it in his Ninth
Dissertation, under the name of Molina, in honour of the author of the
Natural History of Chili. Gærtnera however has the right of priority,
and has been continued by Dr. Roxburgh in his Plants of the Coast of
Coromandel, where he has given a figure and description of the plant,
(vol. i. p. 19. tab. 18.) and by Willdenow in his edition of the Species
Plantarum.</p>

<p>On examining the fructification, we have found the plant more closely
allied to Banisteria than has hitherto been suspected, the styles being
commonly two with a rudiment of a third, and the germen three-locular
with a young seed in each cell; but the inequality of the petals and
stamens, the solitary gland on the calyx, and the abortion of the
lateral seeds, furnish abundant distinctions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">From</span> the Coromandel plants above quoted we learn that it is a large
climbing shrub, growing naturally on the Circar mountains in India, and
is commonly cultivated all over that coast on account of the beauty and
fragrance of its flowers, which open there during the rainy season.
According to Linnæus it is also a native of the Island of Ceylon. No
other species of the genus has yet been described. The plant is
certainly a great acquisition to our collections, and was introduced
from India by the late Lady Amelia Hume about the year 1805. Our
specimen was communicated from the collection at Wormley Bury the end of
last March.</p>

Herts, which before furnished us with the magnificent and unrivalled

Crotalaria, seeds of which were received by her ladyship, about the year
1807, from the East Indies, under the name of C. pulcherrima, which we
have abridged to pulchra, as we can hardly presume to say which species
is most beautiful before we have seen the whole genus, which, from the
large catalogue of Indian species by Dr. Roxburgh in his unpublished
Indian Flora, a copy of which we have seen in the collection of A. B.

echinata of Forster; which error we take the present opportunity of

described, was introduced from the East Indies, at the same time with
the Gærtnera figured in our last number, by the late Lady Amelia Hume.
The roots are fibrous and perennial, as are also the leaves, which rise
from the root upon footstalks embracing one another at the base, and are
of a long lance-shape with strong longitudinal nerves, which are
transversely interwoven with little branching veins. The flower-stalks
are round, rising to from one to two feet in height, with membranaceous
bracts scattered at regular distances, and were four in number in the
specimen which we have figured. The blossoms grow in a kind of raceme
formed of little bunches or tufts of two to four flowers each: the
footstalks are of unequal lengths with a joint near the top, and are
attended by incurved bracts at the base, the lowermost bract at each
tuft being always the largest. The germ is nearly top-shaped, but a
little hexangular upwards. Three of the divisions of the blossom are
just perceptibly broader than the other three, and both the corolla and
nectary are closely pierced with transparent dots hardly visible to the
naked eye, but very distinct when magnified.</p>

<p>We have seen a very good coloured drawing of the plant taken in India in
the collection of J. Fleming, esq. which represents the fruit (which has
not yet ripened in England) as a bluntly oval, fleshy berry, with the
seeds in pairs as in the germ. Both this drawing and the plant received
from India by Lady Amelia Hume were marked <i>Teta viridiflora</i>; Teta
being perhaps (if we may hazard a conjecture) the name applied to the
plant by the native Indians. However this may be, as it appears to be
known in India by that name, we have retained it for the specific
designation; applying to the genus, in conformity to the Linnæan canons,
(from πελιος, lividus, and ανθς, flos,) the name of Peliosanthes. Our
drawing represents the original plant imported from India, with which we
were favoured by Sir Abraham Hume, bart. last April, through the
kindness of A. B. Lambert, esq. who has also informed us, from Dr.
Roxburgh’s MSS. in his possession, that the plant is found growing
naturally about Chittagong in the East Indies. We have just seen two
other species of the genus in the curious collection of T. Evans, esq.
at Stepney, imported by him last Autumn from Prince of Wales’s Island,
of which they are natives. One of them has the leaves nearly of a blue
colour; and Mr. Evans’s collector informs us, that he found five or six
species growing naturally in the island above mentioned, although he had
not the good fortune to bring them alive to England.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Zieria Smithii is a dwarf warty shrub with opposite branches, and
leaves which are composed of three lanceolate leaflets, rough with
transparent dots, which probably secrete an oil, as the bruised leaves
are very fragrant. A few small scattered hairs are just visible on their
upper surface. The panicles of flowers rise from the axils of the
leaves, which they often excel in length, and branch in the same
opposite manner as the stem, with linear bracts at the divisions. The
cups are very short, finely haired and dotted as the leaves. The petals
are broad-lanced, pointed, and slightly tinged with purple on the
outside. The genus was established by Dr. Smith in the fourth volume of
the Linnean Society’s Transactions, and named in memory of his friend
Mr. Zier, whom he calls “an indefatigable botanist, but whose labours
generally gained celebrity under another name than his own.” Were
celebrity only to be gained by real merit, many of the high-sounding
names that now swell the trump of fame would, we fear, have far less
pretensions than Zier. The Zieria Smithii was communicated last April by
A. B. Lambert, esq. from his collection, and we have seen dried
specimens of four other species preserved in his Herbarium, all (like
the present) natives of New Holland, and agreeing in their shrubby
nature, opposite branches, ternate leaves, and axillary bunches of
flowers. None of the species have before been published.</p>

years, no figure of it has before been given in this country. All the
plants which we have seen of it form erect shrubs from four to six feet
in height. The time of blossoming is March and April. We have been
favoured with specimens in blossom from the botanic garden of the
Company of Apothecaries at Chelsea, and with the ripe fruit from Sir
Abraham Hume’s collection at Wormley-bury, but are uncertain who first
introduced it.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> drawing of this remarkable Orange, which has so long been a
desideratum in this country, was taken at Wormley-bury in the beginning
of last May. The plant is a native of China, and Mr. Barrow informs us,
that he found the fruit very common when on his travels in that country,
and in much higher estimation than the common Orange by the Chinese, who
call it Mandarin Orange (answering nearly to the English epithet of
noble) by way of pre-eminence. The same gentleman also informs us, that
he found some fine trees of it in the gardens at the Cape of Good Hope;
it is therefore the more singular that it has been so long in reaching
this country. From Loureiro’s description of his Citrus nobilis, there
can be little doubt of its being intended for the Mandarin Orange;
which, he informs us, grows to a moderately sized tree, and particularly
notices the superior excellence and the depression of the fruit, whose
common size is about five inches across. The plant at Sir Abraham Hume’s
is as yet only about five feet in height, and was imported from Canton
in 1805.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">It</span> is easily distinguished from the common Orange, both by its curious
form and internal structure, the pulp adhering so loosely to the rind as
to be separable from it by the slightest effort, and leaving in many
places a considerable opening between them.</p>
